# glitch-net-GAN

Building custom images dataset using basic web-scrapping technuqies (**Selenium**) and testing it with CycleGAN (**Pytorch**).
_NOTE: You can find my implementation of CycleGAN architecture with examples in my ani-CycleGAN repo._

This repository was created with an aim to show how to find and use dataset for your needs. 

## ToDo:
 - Selenium dataset downloader explanation
 - gui overview
 - struggles and problems, occured in the process
 - X dataset origins : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/splcher/animefacedataset/data
