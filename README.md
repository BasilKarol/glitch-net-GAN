# glitch-net-GAN

Building custom images dataset using basic web-scrapping technuqies (**Selenium**) and testing it with CycleGAN (**Pytorch**).
_NOTE: You can find my implementation of CycleGAN architecture with examples in my ani-CycleGAN repo._

This repository was created with an aim to show how to find and use dataset for your needs.
